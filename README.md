This software system is a Canteen Management System for the students and faculty members of any college. This system will be designed to minimize the queues in the canteen and make hassle-free  payments using the unique id provided to the students and the faculty by the college.

Overview:
1. The pages accessible by the customers include the home page(index.php), full menu (full_menu.php), login (customer_login), register (customer_register.php) and detail of the team(about_us.php)

2. There is also an admin access(admin_area) to add,remove products from the menu and keep a record of the orders. Basically it gives
    the admin a GUI to update the database.

3.  'ecommerce.sql' contains the databse information . Import it into phpmyadmin to create the database.

4. The remaining folders contain the codes for the db connection, bootstrap, javascript,etc.

You add this project to xampp htdocs folder, then create the database in local/phpmyadmin with same name as project name, then run the project as localhost/projectname. MAKE sure to give same name to db.php to connect the datbase. Rest you can change whatever you like.
